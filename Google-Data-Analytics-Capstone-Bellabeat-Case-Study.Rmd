# Step 1: Loading Packages

```{r Loading Packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```
# Step 2: Importing Data

Importing data needed for analysis from `Fitbit` i chose only these data to be used based on the exploration of the data that i made and i decided that these csv files contain the most important data.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "D:/Coursera Data Analysis/CaseStudy")
```

```{R Importing Data}
daily_activity <- read_csv("daily_activity_merged.csv")
hourly_calories <- read_csv("hourly_calories_merged.csv")
hourly_steps <- read_csv("hourly_steps_merged.csv")
hourly_intensities <- read_csv("hourly_intensities_merged.csv")
minute_sleep <- read_csv("minute_sleep_merged.csv")
sleep_day <- read_csv("sleep_day_merged.csv")
weight_loginfo <- read_csv("weight_loginfo_merged.csv")
```

# Step 3: Incpect and Clean Data

```{r}
str(daily_activity)
```
```{r}
glimpse(daily_activity)
```
```{r}
colnames(daily_activity)
```
```{r}
sapply(daily_activity, class)
```

### Change Data Type to Date in Dataframes

to change the data type of `ActivityDay` from `Chr` to `Date` i had to make a new column for the date because when i changed the date type the date gets `N/A` values so i had to add a new column with the right data type.

```{r}
daily_activity$new_date <- dmy(daily_activity$ActivityDay)
hourly_calories$new_date <- dmy(hourly_calories$ActivityDay)
hourly_intensities$new_date <- dmy(hourly_intensities$ActivityDay)
hourly_steps$new_date <- dmy(hourly_steps$ActivityDay)
minute_sleep$new_date <- dmy(minute_sleep$date)
sleep_day$new_date <- dmy(sleep_day$SleepDay)
weight_loginfo$new_date <- dmy(weight_loginfo$Date)
```


### Add Column for Month

Adding column for month to compare between them in the analysis using `month()` function

```{r}
daily_activity$month <- month(daily_activity$new_date)
hourly_calories$month <- month(hourly_calories$new_date)
hourly_intensities$month <- month(hourly_intensities$new_date)
hourly_steps$month <- month(hourly_steps$new_date)
minute_sleep$month <- month(minute_sleep$new_date)
sleep_day$month <- month(sleep_day$new_date)
weight_loginfo$month <- month(weight_loginfo$new_date)
```

### Add Column for Weekdays
Adding weekdays column to study the different habits of users during the week and see if there are any patterns.

```{r}
daily_activity$week_days <- weekdays(daily_activity$new_date)
sleep_day$week_days <- weekdays(sleep_day$new_date)
```
### Changing Column Names to Lowercase

changing column names to lowercase letters using `rename_with`.

```{r}
daily_activity_new <- daily_activity %>%
  rename_with(tolower)

hourly_calories_new <- hourly_calories %>%
  rename_with(tolower)

hourly_intensities_new <- hourly_intensities %>%
  rename_with(tolower)

hourly_steps_new <- hourly_steps %>%
  rename_with(tolower)

minute_sleep_new <- minute_sleep %>%
  rename_with(tolower)

sleep_day_new <- sleep_day %>%
  rename_with(tolower)

weight_loginfo_new <- weight_loginfo %>%
  rename_with(tolower)
```
  
### Renaming Columns

renaming the table `activitydate` to `date` in all data frames that needs to be adjusted

```{r}
names(daily_activity_new)[names(daily_activity_new)== "activityday"] <- "date"
names(hourly_calories_new)[names(hourly_calories_new)== "activityday"] <- "date"
names(hourly_intensities_new)[names(hourly_intensities_new)== "activityday"] <- "date"
names(hourly_steps_new)[names(hourly_steps_new)== "activityday"] <- "date"
```

### Checking Updates

```{r}
names(daily_activity_new)
names(hourly_calories_new)
names(hourly_intensities_new)
names(hourly_steps_new)
```

### Delete N/A values 

i deleted the columns in `sleep_day_new` data frame that had no values in them and as well all the `N/A` values in other data frames

```{r}
daily_activity_new <- subset(daily_activity_new, select = -dateday)
sleep_day_new <- subset(sleep_day_new, select = -...8)
sleep_day_new <- subset(sleep_day_new, select = -...9)
sleep_day_new <- na.omit(sleep_day_new)
weight_loginfo_new <- na.omit(weight_loginfo_new)
```

After deleting the N/A values from the `weight_loginfo_new` there are only two users that are left with complete data so this data frame will not be used because it is unreliable.

```{r}
hourly_steps_new <- na.omit(hourly_steps_new)
hourly_intensities_new <- na.omit(hourly_intensities_new)
minute_sleep_new <- na.omit((minute_sleep_new))
```


### Drop Dataframes

now that i have the new updated and cleaned data frames i will delete the original once because they are not needed for the analysis 

```{r}
rm(daily_activity)
rm(hourly_calories)
rm(hourly_intensities)
rm(hourly_steps)
rm(minute_sleep)
rm(sleep_day)
rm(weight_loginfo)
rm(weight_loginfo_new)
rm(minute_sleep_new)
```


# Step 4: Analyzing the data

making summary for the data to know the min and max and mean and median of the data frames to get valuable insights.

### Daily Activity
The average steps for users are 7638 step per day in an average distance of 5490 km.
The average very active distance is 1.5km in an average time of 21.16 minutes.
The max very active distance is 21.9 km in a max time of 3.5 hours.
The average moderately active distance is 0.5675 k, in an average time of 13.9 minutes.
The average sedentary active distance is 0.001606 and the average sedentary active distance is 17.6 hours or 1058 minutes.
The max sedentary distance is 0.110000 and the max sedentary minutes is 24 hours or 1440 minutes.
```{r}
 summary(daily_activity_new)
```

### Hourly Calories
Hourly minimum calories is 42 and the average calories per hour is 83, the max calories is 948 calories
```{r}
summary(hourly_calories_new)
```

### Sleep Day
The minimum sleep records is 1 record and the max sleep record is 3 and the average is 1.12.
The min time asleep is 1 hour and the average time asleep is about 7 hours and the max time asleep is  13.3 hours.
```{r}
summary(sleep_day_new)
```

### Hourly Steps
The average hourly steps is 333.5 step per hour.
The max recorded step is 10554.
```{r}
summary(hourly_steps_new)
```

### Hourly Intensities
The average hourly intensities is 12.64.
The max hourly intensities is 180.
```{r}
summary(hourly_intensities_new)
```

# Step 5: Visualizations

## Daily Activity

#### Most Total Steps in Week Days

The next visualization shows what weekdays have the highest total steps to see when the users walked the, and as it shows using the `geom_smooth()` we can see that during  Sunday and Saturday had the highest total steps of all week days.

```{r}
ggplot(data = daily_activity_new, mapping = aes(x = totalsteps, y = week_days)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = week_days)) +
  labs(title = " Highest Total Steps in Weekdays") +
  labs(x = "Total Steps", y = "Week Days")
```

And this visualization shows week days with the most total steps, as you can see that Tuesday and Wednesday have the most total steps of the week days

```{r}
ggplot(daily_activity_new, aes(x = week_days, y = sum(totalsteps), fill = week_days)) +
         geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
         labs(title = "Total Steps in Weekdays") +
         labs(x = "Week Days", y = "Total Steps")
```

#### TotalSteps VS Calories

This visualization show the `TotalSteps vs Calories`as you can see that there is a positive  correlation between the total steps and the calories burned, as the steps increase the calorie burning increases,    at the same time people could be in the same step range like others but burn more calories.
```{r}
ggplot(data = daily_activity_new, mapping = aes(x = totalsteps, y = calories, color = new_date)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(aes(y = calories), color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Totalsteps vs Calories") +
  labs(x = "Total Steps", y = "Calories") +
  annotate("text", x = 32000, y = 2500, label = "Highst Total Steps") +
  annotate("text", x = 20000, y = 4700, label = "Highst Total Calories")
```

### Activiy Minutes vs Calories
These visualizations compare different types of activity minutes to the burned calories.

#### Lightly Active Minutes
The visualization shows how the lightly active minutes done by users affects the calories burned, you can see that when the minutes increase the calories being burned also increase.
But also it shows that some cases have more lightly activity minutes but at the same time they burn the same amount of calories as the users who did fewer minutes.
  
```{r } 
ggplot(data = daily_activity_new, mapping = aes(x = calories, y = lightlyactiveminutes, color = new_date)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = lightlyactiveminutes), color = "green") +
  labs(title = "Lightly Active Minutes vs Calories") +
  labs(x ="Calories", y = "LightlyActiveMinutes")
```

#### Very Active Minutes
This visualization compares the `Very Active Minutes` show that when the activity minutes increase the burned calories also increase indicating that there is a positive correlation between very active minutes and calories burned, but at the same time people with 0 minutes that are very active also burn calories a lot.
```{r}
ggplot(data = daily_activity_new, mapping = aes(x = calories, y = veryactiveminutes, color = new_date)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = veryactiveminutes), color = "yellow") +
  labs(title = "Very Active Minutes vs Calories") +
  labs(x = "Calories", y = "VeryActiveMinutes")
```

#### Fairly Active Minutes
There is also a positive correlation between fairly active minutes and calories burned, as the minutes increase the calories burned also increase.
```{R}
ggplot(data =daily_activity_new , mapping = aes(x = calories, y = fairlyactiveminutes, color = new_date)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = fairlyactiveminutes), color = "orange") +
  labs(title = "Fairly Active Minutes vs Calories") +
  labs(x = "Calories", y = "FairlyActiveMinutes")
```

#### Sedentary Minutes
The visualizations indicates that people who spend little time in sedentary activity burn calories but it as well shows that people with higher sedentary minutes also burn the same amount of calories, so there is no correlation between sedentary minutes and burning calories. 
This could mean that the sedentary minutes in some cases affect the calories burned or doesn't affect it, it's hard to make that decision based on this information so i would not rely on it.
```{r}
ggplot(data = daily_activity_new, mapping = aes(x = calories, y = sedentaryminutes, color = new_date)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = sedentaryminutes), color = "red")+
  labs(title = "Sedentary Minutes vs Calories") +
  labs(x ="Calories", y = "SedentaryMinutes")
```


## Sleep Day
Merging two data frames together `sleep_day_new` and `daily_activity_new` to see if the sleeping hours affect the burning fo calories or not.
First merging the data using merge() and creating a new data frame called `sleep_X_activity`.
```{r}
sleep_X_activity <- merge(sleep_day_new, daily_activity_new, by = c('id', 'new_date'))
```

#### Sleeping Hours vs Calories
This visualization show that the sleeping hours has no impact on the calories burned as there is no clear pattern, it changes randomly so its not a direct factor.
```{r}
ggplot(data = sleep_X_activity, mapping = aes(x = hoursofsleep, y = calories, color = calorie))+
  geom_smooth(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Hours of Sleep vs Calories") +
  labs(x = "HoursOfSleep", y = "Calories")

```

#### Total Minutes Asleep in Week Days
The visualization shows that Wednesday's are the most days in the week that users have the highest total minutes asleep in.

```{r}
ggplot(data = sleep_day_new, mapping = aes(x = week_days, y = totalminutesasleep, fill = week_days)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Total Minutes Asleep in Week Days") +
  labs(x = "Week Days", y = "Minutes Asleep")
  
```

## Hourly Steps

#### Activity Hour With the Most Steps
With this visualization you can see what activity hour of the day the users do the most steps in, as you can see using the `geom_col()` the visualization shows that users do the most steps between 12pm and 7pm users do the most steps, and the lowest is between 12am and 4am.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hourly_steps_new, mapping = aes(x = activityhour, y = steptotal, fill = activityhour)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  labs(title = " Most Steps During The Day") +
  labs(x = "Activity Hour", y = "Step Total")
```

## Hourly Calories

This visualization shows the hourly calories burned and as we can see that the most calories burned is between 4pm and 8pm and then gradualy goes down.
The lowest calorie burning is between 12am and 4am

```{r}
ggplot(data = hourly_calories_new, mapping = aes(x = activityhour, y = calories, color = calories)) +
  geom_smooth(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Hourly Calories Burned") +
  labs(x = "Activity Hour", y ="Calories")
```

## Hourly Intensities
The intensities match the hourly burning calories as the highest intensities the user have during the day are between 12pm and 7pm and then starts to go down after that.
The lowest intensity is between 12am and 4am.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hourly_intensities_new, mapping = aes(x = activityhour, y = totalintensity, fill = activityhour))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Hourly Intensities") +
  labs(x = "Activity Hour", y = "Total Intensity")
```

Now we will merge two data frames together to get insight about the calories burned and the intensities.

```{r}
calories_x_intensity <- merge(hourly_calories_new, hourly_intensities_new, by = c('id', 'new_date'))
```

As you can see when the total intensity goes higher the burned calories increas so there is a positive correlation between the two factors.

```{r}
ggplot(data = calories_x_intensity, mapping = aes(x = calories, y = totalintensity)) +
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(title = "Total Intensity vs Calories")+
  labs(x = "Calories", y= "Total Intensity")
```
